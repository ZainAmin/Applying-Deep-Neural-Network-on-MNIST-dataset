# Applying-Deep-Neural-Network-on-MNIST-dataset

Used deep neural network model trained on MNIST dataset to classify images of handwritten digits
- Generates automatic predictions for images. 
- Trained the model on the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, has a training set of 60,000 
  examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
- Achieved an accuracy of 0.9871 after training for 5 epochs.
- Achieved a loss value of 0.0404 after training for 5 epochs.

# Dependencies

Used Keras with Tensorflow backend for the code.
Everything is implemented in the Jupyter notebook which will hopefully make it easier to understand the code.

1) Tensoflow
2) Keras
3) Numpy
4) Matplotlib
